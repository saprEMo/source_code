# SaprEMo: a simplified algorithm for predicting electromagnetic observations

Here we present *saprEMo*.
*saprEMo* is a Python algorithm designed to predict the number of electromagnetic signals characterised by a specific light curve and spectrum, expected in a particular sky survey.  
By looking at past surveys, saprEMo allows us to constrain models of electromagnetic emission or event rates. Applying saprEMo to proposed astronomical missions/observing campaigns provides a perspective on their scientific impact and tests the effect of adopting different observational strategies. <br>
More details can be found in the relative paper at [arXiv:1809.08641](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.08641.pdf).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software:
 - ```Python2.7 ```: to install ```Python2.7 ``` follow the instructions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release)

### Instructions

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

### Running test

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
